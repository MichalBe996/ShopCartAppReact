# ShopCartAppReact


Shopping Cart App made in React. I made whole app using only functional components which was basically new experience to me, as I used to code
all components as class components before. What I noticed is that functional components are whole lot easier to work with and take care of. In src folder you can find
data.js file that contains all products that you want visible on your website. I tried to make this app before using class components and including products while
defining state, but firstly - it wasn't visually coherent and generated lots of different problems. This is not so final version of the program, checkout is yet to be implemented as a form, but this version of app is interactive enough.
